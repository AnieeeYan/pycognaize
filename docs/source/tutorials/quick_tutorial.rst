Quick Tutorial
==============

.. highlight:: python3

.. testsetup::

    from pycognaize import Snapshot
    from pycognaize.tests.resources import RESOURCE_FOLDER
    import os


    os.environ['SNAPSHOT_PATH'] = RESOURCE_FOLDER
    os.environ['SNAPSHOT_ID'] = 'snapshots'

Our main objective in this tutorial is to retrieve the balance sheet table
from a financial report, and create an excel output from it.

To start working with ``pycognaize``, first we need to retrieve the document from a
stored :term:`snapshot`.

.. code-block:: python

    from pycognaize import Snapshot

.. note::

    Snapshot uses environment variables ``SNAPSHOT_PATH`` and ``SNAPSHOT_ID``
    to load the snapshot.
    Before creating a Snapshot object using ``Snapshot.get()``,
    be sure to set the *path* and *id* in the corresponding environment
    variables.

    .. code:: python

            os.environ['SNAPSHOT_PATH'] = "PATH_TO_RESOURCE_FOLDER"
            os.environ['SNAPSHOT_ID'] = "SNAPSHOT_ID"


Now we can create the Snapshot object

.. doctest::

    >>> snapshot = Snapshot.get()
    >>> snapshot # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <pycognaize.document.snapshot.Snapshot object at 0x...>

Alternatively, ``Snapshot`` can be initialized with the corresponding parameters.

    .. code:: python

        snapshot = Snapshot(data_path=..., doc_path=...)

:doc:`Snapshot <../API/_autosummary/pycognaize.document.snapshot.Snapshot>` is a
collection of multiple Document objects

.. doctest::

    >>> snapshot.documents._ids
    ['60215310dbf28200120e6afa', '60b76b3d6f3f980019105dac', '60f5260c7883ab0013d9c184', '60f53e967883ab0013d9c6f9', '60f554497883ab0013d9d906', '62eb8e6b28d7ca0012ec8288', '62eb8e6b28d7ca0012ec8288_error']

As we can see our Snapshot consists of 5 documents,
let's choose one them and have a look at documents structure

.. doctest::

    >>> document = snapshot.documents['60b76b3d6f3f980019105dac']
    >>> document # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <pycognaize.document.document.Document object at 0x...>


Documents are seperated into pages, which we can access
by calling the ``document.pages`` method. Afterwards,
we can select the page we want to work with.
We will choose page 4, as it contains the table that
we need to get.

.. doctest::

    >>> document.pages
    OrderedDict([(1, <Page 1>), (2, <Page 2>), (3, <Page 3>), (4, <Page 4>), (5, <Page 5>), (6, <Page 6>)])
    >>> page_4 = document.pages[4]
    >>> page_4
    <Page 4>

Page object contains :term:`OCR` data and the image of the page. It also
has a lot of useful functionality that you can learn more about
:doc:`here <../API/_autosummary/pycognaize.document.page.Page>`.
In particular, you can search for a text in page object
and get its coordinates.

.. doctest::

    >>> page_4.search_text('Month')
    [{'top': 500, 'bottom': 529, 'left': 1254, 'right': 1361, 'matched_words': [{'left': 1254, 'right': 1361, 'top': 500, 'bottom': 529, 'ocr_text': 'Month', 'word_id_number': 60}]}]


You can also generate an image with the annotations.

.. code-block::

    image = page1.draw_ocr_boxes()

In order to access the table data we need to access the fields which are in
the document object. The document object contains all tagged fields.
Input ``Fields`` are accessed using ``document.x`` and output ``Fields``
are accessed using ``document.y``.
The output of ``document.x`` is an Ordered Dictionary
that has *names* (defined in the :term:`AI Interface`) as keys and ``list`` of
:doc:`Field <../API/_autosummary/pycognaize.document.field>`
objects as values. We can select all table fields using
``document.x['table']``.

.. doctest::

    >>> fields = document.x
    >>> fields
    FieldCollection([('table', [<TableField: table>])])

    >>> table_field = document.x['table']
    >>> table_field
    [<TableField: table>]

.. note::

    There are 5 types of ``field`` objects
        * Numeric Field
        * Text Field
        * Date Field
        * Table Field
        * Area Field

Now, as we have accessed tables, we can select the only table on this page,
and get tags. Tags provide a lot more functionality that will be covered
:doc:`Tag <../API/_autosummary/pycognaize.document.tag>`

.. doctest::

    >>> table_1 = table_field[0]
    >>> table_1
    <TableField: table>

Let's select the table on page 4, and convert it to a pandas dataframe.

``TableTag`` can output a ``pandas.DataFrame`` using ``table_tag.df`` method.


.. doctest::

    >>> table_1_tags = table_1.tags[0]
    >>> table_1_tags
    <TableTag: left: 8.6, right: 92.69999999999999, top: 12.0, bottom: 64.0998>

.. code-block:: python

    >>> table_1_tags.df
                                                0               1                  2
